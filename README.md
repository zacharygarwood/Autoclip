# AutoClip
Autoclip is a program designed to automate the process of posting popular clips from Twitch to YouTube. Since creation, Autoclip has gathered over 16,000 views!

It uses the Twitch API to gather the top clips over a given timeframe, edits the clips together using moviepy, and posts them to YouTube with the use of Selenium.
